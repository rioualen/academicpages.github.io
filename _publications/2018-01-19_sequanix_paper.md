**Abstract**

**Summary.**
We designed a PyQt graphical user interface—Sequanix—aimed at democratizing the use of Snakemake pipelines in the NGS space and beyond. By default, Sequanix includes Sequana NGS pipelines (Snakemake format) (http://sequana.readthedocs.io), and is also capable of loading any external Snakemake pipeline. New users can easily, visually, edit configuration files of expert-validated pipelines and can interactively execute these production-ready workflows. Sequanix will be useful to both Snakemake developers in exposing their pipelines and to a wide audience of users.
