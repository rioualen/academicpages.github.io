**Abstract**

Breast cancer stem cells (bCSCs) have been implicated in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance; 
however, the molecular mechanisms that define this state are unclear. 
We have performed two microRNA (miRNA) gain- and loss-of-function screens to identify miRNAs that regulate the choice between bCSC self-renewal and differentiation. 
We find that micro-RNA (miR)-600 silencing results in bCSC expansion, while its overexpression reduces bCSC self-renewal, 
leading to decreased in vivo tumorigenicity. miR-600 targets stearoyl desaturase 1 (SCD1), an enzyme required to produce active, 
lipid-modified WNT proteins. In the absence of miR-600, WNT signaling is active and promotes self-renewal, whereas overexpression of miR-600 
inhibits the production of active WNT and promotes bCSC differentiation. In a series of 120 breast tumors, we found that a low level of miR-600 
is correlated with active WNT signaling and a poor prognosis. These findings highlight a miR-600-centered signaling network 
that governs bCSC-fate decisions and influences tumor progression.
